102,1233025
103,1241957
104,1267190
105,1326527


_Notes_
Once someone dies, the places after that move up one row
In year 0 everyone has a networth of 10000.

102(!) and 103 should probably have drought management


Farmer down means Locust infestation
Fisher up means Sturgeon migration -> basically every 3 years (next one in 103)

Lower temperature might cause a dip in farmer average income (-2 degrees from normal years)

Trade should be combined with prestige project, because craftsmen don’t like the trades and also local community centres.

Arcadean Farmers don’t like putting drought resistant crops

When there is locust the average drop in gdp by farmers is -32.3082

Fish migration causes 19.19 higher

GDP is all incomes together!

*Gini coefficient*




_Notes_
112 and 115 high temp -> locust

110-115 no extra retirees
So, because of the increased retirement age, we'll have an extra loss in the years 111-114, but none in 115

Gini coefficients of the last few years, in github i have all years in gini-all.csv excluding children
